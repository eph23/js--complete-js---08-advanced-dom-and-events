# üñ•Ô∏è Advanced DOM ‚Äì Jonas Schmedtmann‚Äôs JavaScript Course

## üìò Chapter Overview
This chapter dives deep into the **Document Object Model (DOM)** in JavaScript.  
It focuses on **interacting with, manipulating, and updating web pages dynamically** using advanced DOM techniques.  
Skills gained here are crucial for **building interactive UI components, handling user events, and creating dynamic web apps**.

## üß© Key Topics Covered
- **DOM Selection & Traversal**
  - Selecting elements (`querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`)
  - Traversing the DOM (`parentElement`, `children`, `nextElementSibling`, `closest`)

- **Creating & Inserting Elements**
  - Creating elements (`document.createElement`)
  - Adding classes, text, and attributes
  - Inserting elements (`append`, `prepend`, `before`, `after`)

- **Deleting Elements**
  - Removing elements with `.remove()`
  - Best practices for cleanup

- **Styles, Attributes & Classes**
  - Reading & setting styles (`element.style`, `getComputedStyle`)
  - Managing attributes (`getAttribute`, `setAttribute`, `removeAttribute`)
  - Working with classes (`classList.add`, `remove`, `toggle`, `contains`)

- **Events**
  - Event types (`click`, `mouseover`, `keydown`, etc.)
  - Event listeners (`addEventListener`, `removeEventListener`)
  - Event propagation (bubbling & capturing)
  - Event delegation for efficient event handling

- **DOM Manipulation Techniques**
  - Updating text and HTML content (`textContent`, `innerHTML`)
  - Moving elements in the DOM
  - Cloning elements (`cloneNode`)

- **Advanced Patterns**
  - Using `dataset` for custom data attributes
  - Animations with DOM changes
  - Integrating DOM manipulation with dynamic data (arrays, objects)

## üõ†Ô∏è Practice Projects / Exercises
1. **Bankist App (Advanced DOM Part)**
   - Dynamically render transaction lists, dates, and balances.
   - Update UI based on user actions (transfers, loan requests, account closure).
   - Highlight transactions dynamically using conditional DOM manipulation.
   
2. **Mini Exercises**
   - Creating and appending elements dynamically.
   - Event delegation: handling clicks on a list of items.
   - Updating styles and classes based on user input.
   - Removing and replacing elements in response to actions.

3. **DOM Challenges**
   - Building a tabbed component interface.
   - Creating a modal window with open/close animations.
   - Implementing smooth scrolling to sections.
